# fundamental-analysis-data

Still heavily in progress.

It is to implement a dataset used for fundamental analysis and an API to interact with it.


Notes for later
 - require chrome installed, check [here](https://github.com/password123456/setup-selenium-with-chrome-driver-on-ubuntu_debian)
 - correct web driver should be installed automatically by program

 Notes for fun
 - Yahoo Finance bans you for scraping, and does so quickly
 - not explicitly, but through redirections and misinformation
 - let's hope that the API calls still work
